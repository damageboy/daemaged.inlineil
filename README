This is a post-compiler tool, heavily based on a sample written by mike stall:
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jmstall/archive/2005/02/21/377806.aspx

In short, this utility allows weaving MSIL code into .cs / .vb files,
under specially crafted #if/#endif blocks, and later on, via this tool, 
to weave those IL statements back into the managed assembly.

Mike's code has been updated in these regards:
* being able to work on compiled assemblies instead of source files
* Capable of inserting snippets from more than on file that was a part
  of the generated assembly
* Being able to inset multiple snippets
* Better command line parsing
* Better detection of .NET SDK directoy according to the registry
